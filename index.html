      <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  Hi, I’m Kezia—a linguist, creative technologist, and builder with a passion for bridging communication gaps through immersive design and smart systems. As a senior at UTA majoring in Linguistics with a Computer Science minor, I explore the intersection of language, AI, and digital accessibility.
</p>
<br>
      <p>
  I’m especially fascinated by how machine learning can support language documentation and accessibility. I love learning about NLP tools like BRAT and PRAAT, exploring how Naive Bayes and Neural Nets can help analyze messy, real-world speech data, and understanding how accents and dialects reflect deeper cultural patterns. These kinds of problems light me up.
</p>
      <br>
<p>
  My projects include developing AI-powered web apps, training simulations, and ERP rollouts. I've helped customers with setting up websites and dashboards to monitor sales, keep track of inventory, and keep their customers up to date with new e-learning programs. I love helping people maximize opportunities by bringing their businesses online and fully visible with SEO Optimization. Whether I’m localizing content, analyzing speech patterns, or building tools that respond to how people <i>really</i> communicate (descriptive language over prescriptive language), I’m always looking for ways to make technology more human-centered.
</p>
      <br>
<p>
  I’m bilingual in English and Spanish (heritage speaker of Español), conversational in Mandarin, and familiar with Korean. I thrive on interdisciplinary projects that combine linguistics, tech, and educational gaming to connect people and expand opportunity.

        <h3>G-U-E-S-S (Association Game)</h3>
        <p>A guessing game where you try to find the AI's secret word by association. I'm still working on this interface and game logic. Functionality is present. I love games and want to continue building ones out that operate as functional tools that could serve as a data pipeline for training systems to accommodate people and to give people more knowledge and joy. </p>

        <h3>IPA Cup Toss</h3>
        <p>Guess which IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) symbol links the words. Score for a chance to toss a ball in a cup! It's a study tool for those early in their Linguistics studies or people who want to refresh their knowledge in an amusing way. I know I'm gonna need it hahaha! I'm expanding the scope of the IPA cards as I go. </p>

        <h3>Reward Generator</h3>
        <p>A fun mental health app that awards surprise treats. I worked on this one during my internship in the Summer of 2025. It's got lots of confetti - could you tell that I really, <b>really</b> like confetti? JavaScript indulges me so much :P </p>
