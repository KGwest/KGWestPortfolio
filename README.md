Hi! 

My name is Kezia West and this is my online portfolio. This is a living breathing document so I will be sure to document overal changes to the website here. 



Version 1.0 - Published 6-16-2025
- Personized about me section.
- Descriptive write up on projects so far.
- Resume button mini game added
- Grid box for Books Section completed.
- Added hover functions for Project, Book, and Nav sections.
- Image files are in the main folder (yuck-I know!). Will clean that up in latter iterations.
- I will update the project sections when I complete the projects. They are currently prototypes of ideas and resources I'd like to create. I just need to expand them. Will work on that this summer.
